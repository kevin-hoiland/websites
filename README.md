# Websites

I've probably made dozens of websites since the late 1990s.  But don't get me wrong, I know I'm not a "web developer" :sweat_smile:  I'm just a QA guy that loves to poke around :beers: Anyway, here's some info and links for a few sites I've made over the years :thumbsup:

## Professional

### International Gum Inc
This is my only real public repo on github. It was for a C Corporation I established in the early 2010s.  Basically a chewing gum focused environment with social interactions and a web storefront. The site is no longer up, but there's lots more info available at [International Gum Repository](https://github.com/kevin-hoiland/intlgum "Intl Gum").

### Skyline Christmas Tree Farm
This is a website I made for a Christmas tree farm which lets customers come out and cut their own tree. Pretty fun place :-) The site is still up at [www.skylinechristmastreefarm.com](http://www.skylinechristmastreefarm.com)

## Other

* My wife owns LLC for various work and her website for children's books is live at [www.bydilly.com](http://www.bydilly.com "byDilly LLC")
* My Uncle Bob has a website to link other places and display his books, it's live at [www.penandprint.com](http://www.penandprint.com)
* Other family and friend small sites to support various needs, such as someone running for a political office or raising money for a big combined birthday gift.

## My Personal Site

I've owned the kevinhoiland.com domain since the late 90s. There's certainly been many variations of my personal website over the decades.  Originally my sites were created with just notepad and html. Later I added early versions of CSS to makes things "fancy" (I remember when I used images of rounded corners to fill in a background which _wasn't_ square). Then in the early 2000s I was playing with iFrames for different sections followed by cool fixed side navs with lots of better structured pages (was using Dreamweaver here).  Then in 2012 I started playing with Ruby on Rails, which allowed for easy DB interactions and more robust options. That's when I started adding admin systems for a blog and guestbooks for user interactions.  Then a couple years later I got into the animation craze and played with lots of rotations and things flying in from off page etc lol.  In 2018 I updated the site again to something more basic, which is what's up now at [www.kevinhoiland.com](http://www.kevinhoiland.com)
